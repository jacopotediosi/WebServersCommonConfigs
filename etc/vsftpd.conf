# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets.
# By default, listening on the IPv6 "any" address (::) will accept connections from both IPv6 and IPv4 clients.
# It is not necessary to listen on *both* IPv4 and IPv6 sockets.
# If you want that (perhaps because you want to listen on specific addresses) then you must run two copies of vsftpd
# with two configuration files.

# Customization
# Some of vsftpd's settings don't fit the filesystem layout by
# default.
# This option should be the name of a directory which is empty.  Also, the
# directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used
# as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require filesystem
# access.
